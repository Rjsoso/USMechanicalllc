Since that time, the Bylund family has continuously been in the mechanical contracting industry. The U.S. Mechanical name was adopted 25 years ago, and continues to represent our company owners and employees. We pursue projects in the Intermountain and Southwest regions via hard bid, design build, CMAR, and cost plus. We employ journeyman and apprentice plumbers, sheet metal installers, pipefitters, welders, and administrative staff."
