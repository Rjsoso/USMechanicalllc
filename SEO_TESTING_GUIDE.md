## 🔍 Step 2: Validate Structured Data

### 2.1 Rich Results Test (Google)

**URL:** https://search.google.com/test/rich-results

Test each page:

1. **Homepage:** `https://usmechanical.com/`

3. **Careers Page:** `https://usmechanical.com/careers`
4. **Portfolio Page:** `https://usmechanical.com/portfolio`
5. **Contact Page:** `https://usmechanical.com/contact`

**How to test:**

1. Go to Rich Results Test
2. Paste the URL
3. Click "Test URL"
4. Wait for results
5. Check for errors (should be 0 errors)
6. Expand each schema type to verify data

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ LocalBusiness schema valid
- ✅ Organization schema valid
- ✅ WebSite schema valid
- ✅ WebPage/AboutPage/ContactPage/CollectionPage schema valid
- ✅ BreadcrumbList schema valid
- ✅ ItemList (SiteNavigationElement) schema valid
- ❌ 0 errors
- ⚠️ Warnings are OK (often about missing optional fields)

### 2.2 Schema Markup Validator

**URL:** https://validator.schema.org/

Alternative validator for double-checking:

1. Visit validator.schema.org
2. Paste the full URL
3. Click "Run Test"
4. Check for errors

**Note:** This validator is stricter and may show warnings that Google ignores. Focus on **errors** only.
