# ✅ Sanity Studio URL Found!

## Your Sanity Studio URL

**Base URL**: `https://sanity-henna.vercel.app`

**Structure Page**: `https://sanity-henna.vercel.app/structure`

---

## 🔍 If URL Shows "Not Found"

### Possible Issues:

1. **Vercel Deployment Failed**
   - Check: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Look for project: `sanity-henna` or similar
   - Check deployment status

2. **Domain Not Configured**
   - The Vercel project might not be active
   - Need to redeploy or fix Vercel settings

3. **Wrong URL**
   - Try: `https://sanity-henna.vercel.app` (without `/structure`)
   - Try: `https://sanity-henna.vercel.app/desk`

## ✅ Solution: Deploy to Sanity's Hosting (Recommended)

Instead of Vercel, use Sanity's built-in hosting:

### Deploy Now:
```bash
cd "/Applications/US Mechanical Website/sanity"
npx sanity deploy
```

When prompted:
- Select: **"Create new studio hostname"**
- It will give you: `https://[your-project].sanity.studio`
- Much more reliable than Vercel!

### Your New URL Will Be:
`https://3vpl3hho.sanity.studio`
