**Your website is ready to launch!**

All critical content exists and is properly configured. The empty portfolio projects won't block launch - they simply won't display until content is added.

## 📝 Future Content Tasks (Non-Blocking)

When ready, complete the 4 remaining portfolio projects:
1. Add project titles
2. Assign categories
3. Upload images
4. Add descriptions

These can be done anytime via Sanity Studio without code changes.
