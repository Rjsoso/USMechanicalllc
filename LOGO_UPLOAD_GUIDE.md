# Logo Upload Guide

## Where to Upload the Logo

**All logos must be uploaded to the "Header Section" in Sanity CMS.**

### Steps to Upload/Update Logo:

1. **Go to Sanity Studio**
   - Navigate to your Sanity Studio dashboard
   - Or go to: `https://your-project.sanity.studio`

2. **Find "Header Section"**
   - Look for "Header Section" in the left sidebar or content list
   - Click to open it

3. **Upload Logo**
   - Click on the "Logo Image" field
   - Upload your **transparent background PNG** file
   - Recommended size: At least 500px wide for best quality

4. **Publish Changes**
   - Click the blue "Publish" button (NOT just save)
   - Wait for the confirmation

5. **Clear Cache (if needed)**
   - Hard refresh your browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
   - Changes should appear within 30 seconds

## Logo Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Size**: At least 500px wide recommended
- **Aspect Ratio**: Horizontal logo works best (wider than tall)
- **Background**: Must be transparent (no white or colored background)

## Where the Logo Appears

The logo uploaded to "Header Section" will automatically appear in:
- ✅ Top-left 3D plaque (Header)
- ✅ Navigation menu (CardNav)

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT** upload logos to "Card Navigation" or "Company Information" - those logo fields are not used
- The logo will display on a **gray metallic background** with 15px padding
- The 3D plaque dimensions are 200x124px (mobile) and 260x161px (desktop)
- Logo will scale automatically using `object-fit: contain`

## Troubleshooting

**Logo not updating?**
1. Make sure you clicked "Publish" (not just save)
2. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors
4. Verify you uploaded to "Header Section" (not Card Nav or Company Info)

**Logo looks wrong?**
1. Ensure the image has a transparent background
2. Check the aspect ratio - horizontal logos work best
3. Try a larger image size (at least 500px wide)
